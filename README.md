# Defining Done

### Context

When collaborating to release an open tool, how to define objectives and judge when you're done. 

This document draft was produced as part of the [Accelerating AI in Arts and Humanities project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/1049) and first trialled with [Alto2Txt](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/alto2txt), the first draft made by [@LydiaFrance](https://www.github.com/lydiafrance). In AAAH the objective is to join tools within Digital Arts and Humanities and get them ready for open release and distribution. Working for short periods on tools makes scoping challenging and so we developed a framework to assist conversations with external collaborators. 

With further discussions within the REG there is interest in expanding this discussion more broadly about how we define done when working on projects. 

### What is the Defining Done Document?

There are a series of headings including functionality, documentation, open release. Each has a series of levels from 1-5[✳︎] which can be used for 
1) sharing a common framework/language with the collaborators 
2) agreeing where the RSE should effectively focus their attention 
3) avoid mission creep or changes to scope 
4) know when to say goodbye to the project. 

It roughly follows the principals of a Minimum Viable Product, but with openness, impact, and community building at the centre. 

### Common Language

We have tried using the document in discussion with collaborators to determine the current status of their tool and where they would ideally like it to be. During scoping conversations, we used the document to share a common language to get a view of the tool. Some collaborators may not develop the tool themselves, or may not know software development terminology, and so the document is written non-technically. 

> Example:
> An RSE is funded to work with researchers from the University of Southhampton on their AchillesSpear Tool. During the scoping conversation, the researchers insist their tool "is not functioning", which could mean anything. Discussion with reference to the Functionality Levels reveals the tool works very well internally for a given data set. However, they would like their external collaborators to use it as well and that isn't currently working.

### Scope & Minimum Targets

As a result, minimum targets can be agreed for each heading. This naturally encourages the collaborator to consider what is possible with the time constraints and what areas need the most work.

> Example:
> An external collaborator says they want the RSE to "write more documentation" but this is an open ended target. By referencing to the Documentation Levels, the collaborator and RSE agree that a walkthrough tutorial would be a good target. As the tool is already open, the collaborator and RSE agree that less attention needs to be spent on Open Release work. 

### Avoiding Mission Creep

We found we could work with reference to the minimum targets and it helped us avoid mission creep or unruly tangents. It can be easy to get sucked into creating new features, and so there is clear accountability for the RSE to follow the targets. It is also more clear where time should be allocated if certain areas are further from the minimum target. On the other side, the doneness helps to prevent changes in scope or side quests encouraged by the collaborator. 

> Example:
> The RSE wanted to add features AchillesSpear Tool, but this was not part of the minimum targets. The RSE and collaborator realised they should spend more time on testing the current functionality. 

### Done

When the minimum level are reached, there is a clear ability to say the collaboration is done. This is particularly difficult as functionality, documentation, testing can always be expanded, but this provides an objective end point for work. 

> Example:
> After the collaboration ended, it was clear from the final meeting that the targets had been reached and prividing finality to the collaboration. It made it easier for the RSE to decline further code reviews beyond the funding of the project. 

## Improving the Document

It is part of a bigger conversation within the REG and other RSEs about how to effectively apply their expertise and time and better communicate with collaborators. Please add comments, critiques, and corrections!
